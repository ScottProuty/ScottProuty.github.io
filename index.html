              In my current position at Keysight Technologies, I am developing
              C#-based RF test automation software for a critical NPI. These
              automated tests talk to a DUT with register-level socket
              communication and include S-parameters, time-domain reflectometry
              (TDR), and component-level verification. Each new DUT requires me
              to first build a driver with which to send it basic commands. Then
              I develop methods to control attenuators, amplifiers, switches,
              and other PCB-level components. I also build a control panel GUI
              for each DUT to help troubleshoot. The end goal is to have a full
              suite of tests which can be reliably run at the click of a button
              and the connection of a few cables by a technician.<br />
              To accomplish this, I work with a hardware-focused teammate who
              designs a test board and helps bring up a racks of the necessary
              test equipment. <br /><br />
              On my own, I also started a side project to fully automate test
              station PC setup. In doing this, I significantly reduced the work
              hours required to configure new test stations. Along the way I
              also improved my team's working relationship with Keysight's IT
              team - ensuring that we are aligned regarding PC safety and
              cybersecurity.

          <div class="workDesc">
            Supporting an evolving assortment of Keysight's products over the
            years, I resolved over 450 post-sales issues in Jira Service Desk &
            Salesforce. I worked with sales personnel, application engineers and
            customers themselves. I was the sole USA-based point of contact for
            government and high-security customers for certain products which
            were normally supported in foreign countries. <br />I delivered
            in-person technical training for vector network analyzer service and
            verification, and I filled in documentation gaps occasionally. One
            such gap was with programming examples to help customers get started
            automating their solutions. I jumped on the opportunity to write
            example scripts in C#, C++, Python (using both PyVISA and IVI-COM),
            VB.NET, and Excel VBA. <br />In C#, I developed applications for
            some of Keysight's VXT transceiver products, enabling faster
            diagnosis of hardware, software, and FPGA issues.<br />
            Meanwhile, I was also an active core team member of Keysight's
            largest employee networking group. On the leadership team, we
            organized professional, social, and philanthropic events. We had our
            own budget each year and presented to executives to show the impact
            we were having on company culture and employee retention.

            My first job after graduating from UC Davis, I joined Keysight's
            engineering rotation program. The quantum team was just getting
            started at the time, and they ended up keeping me for almost the
            entire duration of the program. I worked with this team as they set
            up an agile development system using Jira, and as we developed
            Keysight's first few custom solutions for our customers in the
            quantum computing space. These solutions utilized hardware and
            software recently brought into the company's portfolio via an
            acquisition as well as existing equipment. I had several roles in my
            time with the team, including working out the scalability of our
            solution for systems utilizing more qubits, writing VHDL FPGA code
            blocks for use in our FPGA design software, writing documentation
            for the FPGA design software, and visiting with the acquired
            company's employees in Spain for relationship building and
            information transfer.

            I was disappointed with the popular budget tracking options
            available like Mint and YNAB. Instead of creating category "bins" to
            limit spending in, I just wanted a way to see where my money was
            ending up, broken down in a few different ways via nice graphs. I
            created this Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)-based budget
            spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel which makes it easy to input
            expenses, income, and reimbursements through a simple user
            interface. Everything else is done automatically. I'm happy with how
            this turned out and I use it for tracking my own finances. <br />

            of blocks which are colored by the shader code, based on their XYZ
            coordinates. Effort was put into optimizing the render pipeline for
            minimum frame render time. <br />Adapted from Jasper Flick's

#Personal Portfolio Webpage#
This is the first version of the readme started on June 29th.
Right now it is just a THREE.js test page with a big rotating torus. Will eventually turn this into my portfolio page. 
To view the page: 
use command "npm run dev" in git bash and it will give a URL to use to view in Chrome.
